Competition Part 1 - Machine Learning Fall 2019


Your task is to train a classifier for this problem using the provided training data. You will use your classifier to provide predictions on all of the test data (with features in each row of the test file). You will then submit these predictions to Kaggle.  You are free to do this as many times as the contest allows, but in the end you must pick one model to include in your report.
